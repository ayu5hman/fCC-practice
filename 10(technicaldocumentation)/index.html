          <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).</li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.</li>
        

        </ul>

        <p>For Example:

        <code>var myVar = 69; <br>console.log myVar(); </code>

          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW)</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>

        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            <br><br></p>
            <p>
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
            <br><br></p>
            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
            <br>
            <p>JavaScript example: <br></p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { 
                alert("Hello " + yourName); 
            }<br>
                greetMe("World");</code>
                <p>Java example <br></p>
            <code>public class HelloWorld {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
                }
            }
            </code>

          <p>JavaScript is a high-level, versatile, and widely-used programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on the web. It was originally developed by Netscape, Inc. and first released in 1995.</p>
            <ul>
                
                <li>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape Communications Corporation. It was initially called "Mocha" and was later renamed to "LiveScript."</li>
                <p>For Example:</p>
                <code>log 'Hello, World!'
                </code>
                <li>The language was submitted to ECMA International for standardization. ECMAScript, the standard upon which JavaScript is based, was first published in 1997 as ECMA-262.</li>
                <p>For Example:</p>
                <code>add = (a, b) -> a + b <br>
                    log add(3, 5)
                    
                </code>
                <li>JavaScript has continued to evolve, with regular updates to the ECMAScript standard (ES2016, ES2017, ES2018, etc.). Each new version brings enhancements, features, and improvements to the language, making it more powerful and developer-friendly.</li>
            </ul>
